'This mountain is the highest top of Andorra. Coma Pedrosa is a large mountain, that rises more than 1.500 meters above the village of Arinsal, situated at the bottom of a narrow valley. In winter and spring, snow and ice cover the summit and surroundings, and then it’s the best opportunity to use the skies, ice-axe and crampons or even the snowshoes.',
'No permits or fees are required to climb Coma Pedrosa. It’s important to advise that in ski season can be complicated to find place to park the car at the end of the road that gets to the Arinsal ski resort, where starts the normal route to climb Coma Pedrosa. So you’ll need to get up early.
To climb this mountain from the French or Spanish side you’ll have to cross the border, located in high mountain areas. This isn’t a problem at all. Only in the border of the main roads you will find customs. ',

('Mont Blanc', 4808, 'Basic Snow/Ice Climb',
'Mont Blanc is a massif composed of many peaks and spires, each with their own routes. The massif straddles the French-Italian border. Sources vary as to what is the precise border between Italy and France. Fact sheets consistently list Monte Bianco di Courmayeur, a summit not far from Mont Blanc, as  highest point of Italy and French and Swiss maps also show this to be the border. However, most insist that the border crosses Mont Blanc itself. This is informational only. See a more complete explanation in the History section below. Unless some fool decides to build something there, the politcal line is merely a human construction which should not detract from the beauty of the place and its spectacular views. The summit belongs to climbers who are willing to make the effort to visit this windswept place! ',
 'There are so many routes that embrace every degree of difficulty!Noraml, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western',
 'Mont Blanc is reached either from Chamonix in the Savoy valley in France or from Courmayeur in the Val da Aosta in Italy. The valleys on the Italian side form a T, with the NW-SE trending Val da Aosta forming its vertical leg. At Entreves at the NW end of Val da Aosta, Val Veny splits off to the SW and Val Ferret splits off to the NE. Both public transportation and private car will easily reach these destinations. Chamonix (N506) and Courmayeur (E21B) lie along major highways and major rail lines. If coming from Switzerland and points east, Chamonix is reached by way of Martigny, Switzerland. One can continue through Chamonix and the Mont Blanc tunnel to reach Val da Aosta or one can continue south from Martigny, over St. Bernard Pass to Aosta and then NW to Courmayeur.
Traveling between the French and Italian sides of the mountain has been made faster and simpler by the 11.6 km long Mont Blanc tunnel, which is a major route across the Alps.'),

('Rysy', 2499,'Scramble','The twin summitted peak is located in the central part of High Tatras in their main ridge ,on the borderline between Poland and Slovakia.
The north-western summit of Rysy(2499,2) is the highest point of Poland, and therefore in the summer the mountain is climbed by a lot of people from the Polish side.
It is a very steep uphill, but does not require technical climbing. Separate climbing routes are some of the best in the country. The slopes on the Slovakian side are a lot gentler and therefore not less crowded in the high season.

Rysy is the highest peak of Tatras accessible by marked route what explains its great popularity during summer season.

Rysy summit offers one of the widest and richest summit panoramas in Tatras. By good weather conditions one can admire all prominent High Tatra peaks ,several lakes ,Low Tatra mountain range and Western Beskidy mountains.

Magnificent 500 meter high eastern face ,long alpine climbing routes of high difficulties.

Wonderful alpine flora.

The name of the peak
There were some historical disputes about that.
The current version says that the name Rysy comes from the characteristic, long, diagonal couloir crossing western cliffs.
It is also called "Rysa". In Polish rysa means just a scratch ,crack ,fissure.

The name of the peak is the same both in Polish and Slovak languages.','There are two paths to the summit of Rysy; one from the Polish side and one from the Slovak side. Since both countries joined the European Union in May 2004, it is now possible to ascend from one side and descend the other, and this is undoubtedly best done travelling north to south, i.e. from Poland into Slovakia.',' Whilst the refuge at Schronisko przy Morskim Oku is the most practical starting point for the ascent of Rysy, vehicular access to both the hut and lake is strictly controlled. Private cars must be parked near the valley floor at a place called Palenice Bialczanska, entrance to the National Park. This is a distance of 9km and would add about 2 hours if walked. But there is an alternative to trudging along the asphalt road. Horse drawn carts provide a regular passenger service, stopping a kilometre shy of the lake.

The nearest town and main access point on the Polish side of the High Tatra is Zakopane. The nearest airport is at Kraków, and the two towns are linked by both rail and bus services. Warsaw is likewise connected.

From Zakopane there is a bus service to and from Palenice Bialczanska.

Alternatively, if entering from Slovakia, a bus can be taken from Stary Smokovec and it''s neighbouring villages to Lysá Polana close to the boarder. Here one can walk through the customs post and either hitch a lift or walk the kilometre to the National Park entrance. '),


('Elbrus', 5633, 'Basic Snow/Ice ClimbBasic Snow/Ice Climb','Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in the Caucasus, and the highest peak in Europe. It is located several miles north of the main crest of the Central Caucasus, in the Russian Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia, north of Georgia.

Its origin is volcanic, and though it has long been extinct, it still retains its gently sloping, conical shape, with twin cones rising on its summit. The west summit at 5,642 meters (18,510 ft) is slightly higher than the east at 5,621 metres (18,442 ft).

The summit is capped in ice year round, and 22 glaciers sprawl from its slopes. All told, the mountain and its vast glaciers cover 56 square miles. The summit provides spectacular views of the entire Caucasus.', 'Various have been used to reach the summit of Elbrus, the present Normal Route is possibly the easiest and safest and is of course the fastest on account of the cable car and chairlift system. This route and associated hazards of the ascent are described on separate pages of this site.

There are several more demanding and adventurous ways up the mountain. A touring ascent starts from below the cable-way Mir station and heads west over glacier slopes towards the Khotiutau pass. Some distance before reaching this the south spur of the Kiukurtliu Cupola is climbed to a broad glaciated saddle behind pt.4912 (top of the SW spur). Now a rising traverse north is made to attain the easy NW spur by which the summit is gained. This expedition involves 3 nights camping-bivouacs; parties also need a rope, axe and crampons. See details.

Climbing Elbrus from other directions is a tougher proposition because of lack of permanent high facilities. Freshfield always maintained that a route from the east up the Iryk valley, Irykchat glacier and over the Irykchat pass (3667m) on to snowfields below long rock ribs of the east spur would become the shortest and most used approach. A hut built long ago on the north side of the lrykchat pass is now wrecked, and in any event the vertical interval calls for at least 2 camp-bivouacs. See details.

Remote climbs include the NE slopes starting across the Jikaugenkiez ice plateau, and from near the Buruntash pass by the classical north side glaciers (see historical notes) where the average angle is greater than on the east and south slopes. Routes from the west (Khurzuk) side are in the mountaineering category; the NW spur from the Batkbashi pass is fairly straightforward while more direct lines from the hollow of the Kiukurtliu glacier are more serious. Until recently permissions were needed to attempt these climbs.','The nearest airports and rail way station from the Mount Elbrus area are in Mineralnye Vody (200km to the Elbrus area) and Nalchik (about 120km). To reach these towns, one may take flights from Moscow, St Petersburg and some other Russian cities. There is a direct flight from Munich to Mineralnye Vody as well. Also there is train connection from the main Russian cities to Mineralnye Vody and Nalchik. Though Nalchik is closer to Mt Elbrus most of people travel via Mineralnye Vody as there is the biggest airport and rail way station in the region with several daily flights and good train connections.'),

Rising to 6,217 feet (1,895 m), it is the highest mountain in the Urals range. Several small glaciers are found on the slopes of Narodnaya and nearby mountains. Coniferous forests lie on the lower slopes of the mountain, giving way fairly quickly to tundra higher up. The gentler slopes are used as reindeer pasture in summer.', ' ', ' '),

('Ararat', 5137, 'Not technically difficult but requires good levels of fitness and stamina.', 'From north to south and east to west, Armenia is simply bound by chains of mountains.
The Sevan Mountains are the oldest standing in Armenia, about 380-1,200 million years old. Volcanoes and massive earthquakes formed the base of the mountainous region, carving mountains, valleys and plateaus on a land that now has an average altitude of 2000 meters (6,560 ft), with less than 10% of the country lying below 1000 meters (3280 ft.). Ararat rises from a flat plain and dominates the skyline of Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. Since ancient times, Ararat has been revered by the Armenians as their spiritual home and as the home of the gods of the Armenian pantheon. Ararat is the national symbol of Armenia though it is located in Eastern Turkey on the borders of Iran, Armenia (formerly USSR) and Nakhijevan.

This volcanic mountain rises 5,165 meters or 16,945 feet high, far above the plains that are at 2,000-3,000 feet high, and is the highest location in the ancient kingdom of Urartu, a region which covered thousands of square miles with hundreds of mountains.

The summit of Mt. Ararat is 5,165 meters above sea level. It is higher than any mountain in the continental United States except for Alaska or in Europe outside the Caucasus.', 'The Southern route of Ararat starts in Dogubayazit.  It is rated 1 (easiest in the snow), but the difficulty is in acclimatization and the changeable weather conditions.  Ararat, at an elevation of 5165 meters, is the highest mountain in Turkey by 1000 meters.  The climb becomes very steep very fast, and most mountaineers are quickly affected by mountain sickness.', 'Ararat railway station, by car'), 

('Maja e Korabit', 2764, 'Walk up','Maja e Korabit (albanian) or Golem Korab (macedonian) both refer to the same, 2763m/9068f high mountain right on the border between Albania and Macedonia. It is a highest mountain for both countries, one of two summits in Europe being national highpoint for more then one country, and 12th highest national point in Europe. Name "Korab" is of Slav origin, it was considered to be a God of sea by various Slavic tribes, before they have switched to christianity. Korab may be considered an off the beaten track mountain resort, at least by the European standards.
Location: Mt. Korab ispanning in a slightly NE to SW orientation, from Golema Korabska vrata pass (2062m) on the nordern end, to the Mali e Grames, just after the Ciganski premin pass on the southern end. A rugged main ridge as well as the summit itself do offer both great and extensive views in all directions (please, see the panoramas further down the page). Beacuse of the bordercrossing policy between two countries and the logistical issues, ascending from the one side and descending down the other side of the mountain currently is not feasible, some day in the future this may change, though.','MTB route Golem Korab / Maja e Korabit - The peak of Macedonia & Albania is situated in National Park Mavrovo in Macedonia. Golem Korab (Albanian: Maja e Korabit) peak is situated on Korab mountain just at the border line between Macedonia and Albania. The peak is the highest elevation point of both countries at 2764 meters over the sea level. The ascent section of the route is placed on very steep carriageway and singletrack. Count to hike with the bike at least 50% of total ascent section. The trail is dry and rocky. Due to many unlabeled junctions the GPS unit with the uploaded route is a must for fast and safe navigation. The attached GPS tracklog includes the waypoints of the springs of the water.','Closest intl airports are those of Tirana (Albanian capital) and Skopje ( capital of FYRO Macedonia). To someones disbelief it may be, but geographical distance from Korab to any of those 2 airports is almost the same, mile or km more or less. Skopje has decent train connections with rest of Europe hence some major routes to Thessalon 
iki/Greece pass through the Macedonian capital . Please, reffer to German railways connection query. By car: for the sake of convinience and accesibility by road, we`ll stick with the Macedonian route. and our main goal is to reach the trailhead at Stezimir watchtower on the Macedonian side of the mountain. In order to achieve that, we`ll going to hit the Skopje -Tetovo motorway (around 40km of that one). From Tetovo - no need to go into the town - another 30 km of surfaced roadleading SW takes us till town Gostivar where we catch with the Gostivar-Debar road. Another 20 km or so up the Gostivar-Debar road takes us to Mavrovi Anovi, Mavrovi Anovi is rather small town a common point for short trip break with several food shops, restaurants, and one Hotel. This is where we are going to refill our supplies with all the neccessary food and liquid. Only in case we didnt mind to carry those all the way from Skopje, that is.

At the edge of this meadow was the Refugi de Coma Pedrosa, a little lodge you could stay at to break up the long climb. It was swarming with people, and I decided to keep my distance from it.
Past the lodge there were fewer people, probably because everyone had started much earlier than me and were already done for the day. I crossed the meadow and started climbing higher until I reached huge patch of snow on the edge of a little pond – Estany Negre. The Andorran snow tasted about the same as any other snow, and I looked forward to glissading back down on my descent.
At the top of the snow the trail veered onto a steep rocky ridge that required some scrambling once in a while – it was pretty fun. To the right the mountain dropped sharply away all the way to Arinsal, and to the left it dropped into a big bowl with an icy pond in the middle. ');
